      "description": "I attended an daylong meditation retreat online. One of the instructors was a psychiatrist who has written a lot about anxiety and habit loops. One of the recurring themes was curiosity. When we feel anxious or compelled to indulge in some type of bad habit, we can get curious about the feeling instead: curiosity can create some space between ourselves and a compulsion or reaction, which reduces bad habits. One quote I really liked: 'there's no such thing as two steps forward, one step backward, as long as there's awareness and a willingness to learn'.",

      "description": "I caught myself mindlessly snacking after a stressful day at work. It's so interesting how easy it is to go into autopilot without thinking. I'm grateful I was able to become aware of the behavior in the middle of it, and to be kind and compassionate to myself without criticizing or judging myself.",
